FB15K-DB15K and FB15K-YAGO15K. We conduct experiments in FB15K-DB15K and FB15K-YAGO15K datasets which are widely used datasets on MMEA task. FB15K-DB15K is an EA dataset of FB15K and DB15K MMKG. It includes 12,846 entity seeds. FB15K-YAGO15K is an EA dataset of FB15K and YAGO15K KGs. It includes 11,199 entity seeds.


P-MMEA. Aiming at the log records related to numerous equipment defects in the power field, we construct an MMEA dataset of equipment defects in the power field called P-MMEA. It contains two MMKGs P-MMKG1 and P-MMKG2, from different data sources. P-MMKG1 consists of 3,498 relations, 2,363 entities, and 3,077 attributes, including 1,032 images and 2,045 other literal types of attributes. P-MMKG2 consists of 3,531 relations, 2,363 entities, and 3,132 attributes, including 1,044 images and 2,088 literal types of attributes. P-MMEA includes 2,117 entity seeds.
